<small>As of July 1, I am the Interim Chair of the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.jhu.edu).  While I enjoy the term _Congratudolences_, I'm quite looking forward to dipping my toe in the leadership water, seeing how the sausage gets made, etc. I represent a great group of faculty at an interesting time.  Interim means that CS@JHU is actively seeking a Head of Computer Science, please [apply](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/about/employment-opportunities/).</small>

Here are a couple of interesting recent items:
  * [Chair's Message](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/)
  * [My recent interest in ML software architectures.](http://randalburns.github.io/08/29/ml/)
  * [Course: ATIDIC Fall 2018](https://github.com/randalburns/atidic-fall18/wiki/)

Randal Burns is a Professor and Interim Chair of [Computer Science](http://www.cs.jhu.edu) in the [Whiting School of Engineering](http://wse.jhu.edu) at [Johns Hopkins University](http://jhu.edu).  His research interests lie in building the high-performance, scalable data systems that allow scientists to make discoveries through the exploration, mining, and statistical analysis of big data. 

In recent years, he has focused on data-systems for high-throughput neuroscience.  He is a co-founder of [NeuroData](http://neurodata.io) along with [Joshua Vogelstein](http://jovo.me).  NeuroData democratizes access to world-class data sets, including electron-microscopy connectomics, CLARITY, MRI, and array tomography data.  

Randal is a core member of the [JH Turbulence Database Group](http://turbulence.pha.jhu.edu).  He and his students have built Open Numerical Laboratories in which anyone can explore, mine, and analyze world-class turbulence simulations.

At Johns Hopkins, Randal is both a member of and on the steering committee of the [Kavli Neuroscience Discovery Institute](http://hub.jhu.edu/2015/10/01/kavli-neuroscience-discovery-institute/).  He is a member of the [Institute for Data-Intensive Science and Engineering](http://idies.jhu.edu).

Prior to arriving at JHU in 2002, Randal was Research Staff Member at [IBMâ€™s Almaden Research Center](http://www.almaden.ibm.com) in San Jose.  He earned his Ph.D. in 2000 and M.S. in 1997 from the [Department of Computer Science](http://cs.ucsc.edu) at the [University of California at Santa Cruz](http://ucsc.edu]) (_Go Slugs!_).  He earned his B.S. degree from the [Department of Geophysics](http://geophysics.stanford.edu) at [Stanford University](http://stanford.edu) (_Go Cardinal!_)
