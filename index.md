<small> I'm most recently interested in the interaction between algorithms for machine learning and the memory hierarchy.  This was the topic of my most recent class [Advanced Topics in Data-Intensive Computing](https://github.com/randalburns/atidic-fall17/wiki/Advance-Topics-in-Data-Intensive-Computing).  We've had some initial papers in this direction. [knor (K-means NUMA optimized routines)](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3078607) is the fastest k-means out there for R on [GitHub](https://github.com/neurodata/knorR) and sometimes [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/knor/index.html). [Disa](https://disa-mhembere.github.io/) won the best presentation award for this work at [HPDC](http://www.hpdc.org/2017/awards/best-paper-award/). Also, [Da's](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~zhengda/) paper [FlashR: Parallelize and Scale R for Machine Learning using SSDs](https://ppopp18.sigplan.org/program/program-PPoPP-2018?date=Tue%2027%20Feb%202018#modal-phid_2a5356a715907261e32f9089b2db5e85) is a best-paper award candidate at the upcoming [PPoPP](https://ppopp18.sigplan.org/home).

Randal Burns is a Professor of [Computer Science](http://www.cs.jhu.edu) in the [Whiting School of Engineering](http://wse.jhu.edu) at [Johns Hopkins University](http://jhu.edu).  His research interests lie in building the high-performance, scalable data systems that allow scientists to make discoveries through the exploration, mining, and statistical analysis of big data. 

For the last five years, he has focused on data-systems for high-throughput neuroscience.  He is a co-founder of [NeuroData](http://neurodata.io) along with [Joshua Vogelstein](http://jovo.me).  NeuroData democratizes access to world-class data sets, including electron-microscopy connectomics, CLARITY, MRI, and array tomography data.  

Randal is a core member of the [JH Turbulence Database Group](http://turbulence.pha.jhe.edu).  He and his students have built Open Numerical Laboratories in which anyone can explore, mine, and analyze world-class turbulence simulations.

At Johns Hopkins, Randal is both a member of and on the steering committee of the [Kavli Neuroscience Discovery Institute](http://hub.jhu.edu/2015/10/01/kavli-neuroscience-discovery-institute/).  He is a member of the [Institute for Data-Intensive Science and Engineering](http://idies.org).

Prior to arriving at JHU in 2002, Randal was Research Staff Member at [IBMâ€™s Almaden Research Center](http://www.almaden.ibm.com) in San Jose.  He earned his Ph.D. in 2000 and M.S. in 1997 from the [Department of Computer Science](http://cs.ucsc.edu) at the [University of California at Santa Cruz](http://ucsc.edu]) (_Go Slugs!_).  He earned his B.S. degree from the [Department of Geophysics](http://geophysics.stanford.edu) at [Stanford University](http://stanford.edu) (_Go Cardinal!_)
