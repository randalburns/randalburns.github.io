Randal Burns is a Professor of [Computer Science](http://www.cs.jhu.edu) in the [Whiting School of Engineering](http://wse.jhu.edu) at [Johns Hopkins University](http://jhu.edu).  His research interests lie in building the high-performance, scalable data systems that allow scientists to make discoveries through the exploration, mining, and statistical analysis of big data. 

Recently, he has focused primarlily on high-throughput neuroscience.  He is a co-founder of [NeuroData](http://neurodata.io) along with [Joshua Vogelstein](http://jovo.me).  NeuroData democratizes access to world-class data sets, including electron-microscopy connectomics, CLARITY, MRI, and array tomography data.  

Randal is a core member of the [JH Turbulence Database Group](http://turbulence.pha.jhe.edu).  He and his students have built Open Numerical Laboratories in which anyone can explore, mine, and analyze world-class turbulence simulations.

At Johns Hopkins, Randal is both a member of and on the steering committee of the [Kavli Neuroscience Discovery Institute](http://hub.jhu.edu/2015/10/01/kavli-neuroscience-discovery-institute/).  He is a member of the [Institute for Data-Intensive Science and Engineering](http://idies.org).  He is on the Steering Committee of the [Science of Learning Institute](http://scienceoflearning.jhu.edu/).

Randal spent 2015-2016 on sabbatical at the [Los Alamos National Laboratories](http://lanl.gov) working in the [Data Science at Scale](https://datascience.lanl.gov/) Team where he continues to consult on how to make HPC codes repeatable and portable acrross heterogeneous systems with modern hardware.

Prior to arriving at JHU in 2002, Randal was Research Staff Member at [IBMâ€™s Almaden Research Center](http://www.almaden.ibm.com) in San Jose.  He earned his Ph.D. in 2000 and M.S. in 1997 from the [Department of Computer Science](http://cs.ucsc.edu) at the [University of California at Santa Cruz](http://ucsc.edu]) (_Go Slugs!_).  He earned his B.S. degree from the [Department of Geophysics](http://geophysics.stanford.edu) at [Stanford University](http://stanford.edu) (_Go Cardinal!_)
