title: Projects and Software
---

I am currently working on software systems that provides data analysis and visualization solutions for large scale data that would otherwise be inaccessible.  The can be roughly grouped into three categories:

## Scale-Up Analysis Frameworks

### Software
  - The [FlashX](https://github.com/zheng-da/FlashX) tools for big data analysis of graphs and matrixes.

### Active Projects
  - “From RAGs to Riches: Utilizing Richly Attributed Graphs to Reason from Heterogeneous Data.” Co-PI
with J. Vogelstein (PI), and C. Priebe. DARPA N66001-15-C-4041.


## Cloud Systems for NeuroData Processing

### Software
  - [NeuroData Store](https://github.com/neurodata/ndstore)
  - [NeuroData Viz](https://github.com/neurodata/ndviz)
  - [NeuroData TileCache](https://github.com/neurodata/ndtilecache)

### Funded research
  - "Synaptome of Mouse and Man." PI with PI Stephen Smith. [NIH 1R01NS092474](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_description.cfm?projectnumber=1R01NS092474-01)
  - "Neural Circuits in Zebrafish: Form, Function and Plasticity." Co-PI with PI Engert. [NIH 1U01NS090449](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?icde=0&aid=8826324).
  - " Computational Infrastructure for Brain Research: EAGER: BrainLab CI: Collaborative, Community Experiments with Data-Quality Controls through Continuous Integration." PI Burns. [NSF 1649880](http://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1649880&HistoricalAwards=false).

## Analysis of Numcerical Simulations

### Software
  - Johns Hopkins Turbulence Databases [Web Services](http://turbulence.pha.jhu.edu/)
  - Build and Execute Environments [BEE Launcher](https://datascience.lanl.gov/bee.html)

### Funded research

  - "CIF21 DIBBs: Long Term Access to Large Scientific Data Sets: The SkyServer and Beyond." Co-PI with PI Szalay. [NSF 1261715](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1261715&HistoricalAwards=false)
  - "CDS&E: Studying Multiscale Fluid Turbulence via Open Numerical Laboratories." Co-PI with PI Meneveau [NSF 1507468](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1507469&HistoricalAwards=false).
