I am currently working on software systems that provides data analysis and visualization solutions for large scale data that would otherwise be inaccessible.  The can be roughly grouped into categories:

## Reproducibile Data Science
  - [Gigantum](https://gigantum.com) for decentralized data science. "Build it. Move It. Share It."

## Scale-Up Analysis Frameworks
  - The [FlashX](https://github.com/zheng-da/FlashX) tools for big data analysis of graphs and matrixes.

## Cloud Systems for NeuroData Processing
  - [NeuroData](https://neurodata.io)

## Analysis of Numcerical Simulations
  - Johns Hopkins Turbulence Databases [Web Services](http://turbulence.pha.jhu.edu/)
