### Big Data.....um!

I recently found the following [video](https://vimeo.com/112954548}) from the Kavli China-America Frontiers of Science Symposium.  It was an awesome event with international exchange between Academies of Science. I remember giving this talk and I like the content and presentation.  With the exception of my "um" habit.  Often when I lecture, I hear myself and think of Mr. Mackey from South Park, "mmmm....hmmm".

This was an introduction to a session on  __Big Data__ in a time in which it was evolving from large data sets to machine learning. The core concept, that data cannot be interpreted outide of models and causality, remains.  As does the unfair accusation that big data abandaons the scientific method.
