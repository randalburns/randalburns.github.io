Randal Burns is a Professor of [Computer Science](http://www.cs.jhu.edu) in the [Whiting School of Engineering](http://wse.jhu.edu) at [Johns Hopkins University](http://jhu.edu).  His research interests lie in building the high-performance, scalable data systems that allow scientists to make discoveries through the exploration, mining, and statistical analysis of big data. 

The last five years of his career have focused primarlily on high-throughput neuroscience.  He is the founder of the OpenConnectome Project (http://openconnecto.me) and NeurodData (http://neurodata.io) sites that democratize access to world-class data sets, including electron-microscopy connectomics, CLARITY and array tomography data.  Recent neuroscience publications that describe public data sets appear Cell (2015), Nature Scientific Data (2015, 2014), and Neuron (2014).  Burns' former PhD students include an Assistant Professor at the California Polytechnic Institute (Peterson, 2009), a Research Associate Professor at the University of Chicago, and a scientist at HHMI Janelia Farm building the data pipeline for Fly EM (Perlman, 2011).  Post Hasan (2012) is a Assistant Professor at Univ. of Alabama Birmingham.`kkkkkkkk
